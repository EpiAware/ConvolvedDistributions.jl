# The quadrature-window endpoint is a non-differentiable hyperparameter
# (just *where* to integrate), so its primal-stripping helper and the
# window-quantile call itself carry no gradient. Marking them
# `@non_differentiable` keeps reverse-mode AD — and Mooncake, which lifts
# ChainRules rules — off `quantile`'s `gamma_inc_inv` path for a `Gamma`
# integration component.

# The analytical partials live in `_gamma_cdf_value_and_partials` (in
# `src/gamma_ad.jl`) so the ForwardDiff Dual path and the direct Enzyme
# rule share the same formulas. Only the k-partial is non-trivial — that's
# the term SpecialFunctions' own ChainRule leaves as `@not_implemented`;
# see `_grad_p_a_series` for the series form (Moore 1982 AS 187, the same
# construction Stan and JAX use).

# `nothing` for an undefined rule and trips `iterate(::Nothing)`.
